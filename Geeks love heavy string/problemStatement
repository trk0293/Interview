Geeks love Heavy String Submissions: 145   Accuracy: 8.97%   Max. Score: 100

Given two Strings of lowercase characters, where characters have GeeksforGeeks defined values as below :
a -> 1
b -> 2
c -> 3
...
y -> 25
z -> 26

Your task is to print the maximum weight of the heavier String, where weight of the string is calculated as below :

Weight of the String = maximum weight of characters

Weight of Character = GeeksforGeeks defined value of character + number of occurences of character + index of character + second maximum prime factor of length of string

Note :

Each appearing character in the string is considered only once for calculating weight of the string.
In case, second maximum prime factor does not exist, take the maximum prime factor of length of string for calculations.
Input : First line of Input contains number of Testcases T. For each testcase, first line contains String 1 and second line contains String 2.
Output : For each testcase, print the maximum weight of heaviest string. In case of similar weight, print "equal", without quotes.

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10
2 <= Length of String <= 10^4

Example :
Input :
1
strings
heavy
Output :
157

Explanation :
Weight of strings = 157
Weight of heavy = 106
So, Heavy String is "strings" with maximum weight = 157.
